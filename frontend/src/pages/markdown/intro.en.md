## About Us

The SITCON (Student IT Conference), initiated in 2012, is student-oriented and organized entirely by students. We have long been committed to student information education and the promotion of the open-source spirit, hoping to guide more young learners into the hall of computing. We also aspire for all students interested in information technology to gather at the conference, to exchange ideas, pass on knowledge, inspire each other, and embody the principle of “applying what you learn and learning through teaching.”

## Lines of Flight

_Il s'agit toujours de libérer la vie là où elle est prisonnière_

**It is always about liberating life where it is imprisoned.**

“Lines of Flight” is a concept from contemporary literature proposed by the French philosopher Gilles Deleuze. It refers to finding a crack or opening within everyday social structures, and discovering new possibilities within the existing framework. The word “Lines” represents multiple possible routes of escape. We are not limited to a single choice or method, but rather have many directions to break through boundaries, pursue innovation, and explore new possibilities.

Just like in our own era, human ingenuity has created a world never seen before. Surrounded by the many dividends of technology—convenience, speed, and more—we also see the social media addiction brought by the circulation of information, the self-imposed limits within societal values, and the subtle sense of alienation built by screens. All of this seems like an invisible shackle constructed by technology, binding us within.
