## üì£ Referral System

### üéØ Functionality Goals
Enable each registered user to have a unique referral link to share with friends. Track referral effectiveness and spread patterns, support random draws, statistical analysis, and visualization.

### üë§ Frontend Features

#### 1. Post-Registration Referral Information
**Display:**
- Unique referral link with user identification parameter
```
https://sitcon.org/2026/register?ref=abcdef123456
```
- Share buttons (copy, Line, Facebook, X)

#### 2. Auto-populate Referrer Field
When users enter through referral links, the system will:
- Automatically store referrer identification code in form data (non-public field)
- Allow backend to view referrer for each registration

### üõ†Ô∏è Backend Features

#### 1. Referrer Association Query and Display
- Add "Referrer (Check-in Code + Email + Name)" field to each order
- **Filter Support:**
  - All registrants referred by specific user
  - Registrations without referrers
- Support referral tree visualization (expansion diagram)

#### 2. Referral Tree Visualization
**Display expansion relationship diagram with referrer as root:**
- Hierarchy levels (which invitation level)
- Nodes showing referrer + count
- Support node expansion/export of all registrants in tree

#### 3. Qualified Referrer List and Random Sampling
- Set thresholds (e.g., "refer 2+ people")
- Display all qualified referrers
- **Provide:**
  - CSV export (referrer check-in code, name, email, referral count)
  - Random selection of N qualified referrers (built-in random draw mechanism)

#### 4. Statistics and Reports
**Display:**
- Referral count leaderboard (sortable)
- Referral count distribution chart (bar chart)
- Multi-level referral counts (e.g., Level 1: 120 people, Level 2: 38 people...)

### üîÑ Flow Diagram (with Referral System)

```
[User A completes registration]
     ‚Üì
Generate A's unique link: https://.../?ref=A1234
     ‚Üì
[User B enters through A's link]
     ‚Üì
User B completes registration (system records ref=A1234)
     ‚Üì
Backend shows: B's referrer is A
     ‚Üì
A's referral count +1
     ‚Üì
Backend statistics, tree diagram update, referral threshold check ‚Üí Enter draw pool
```

## ‚úÖ Engineering Considerations

- Each registrant must have a unique check-in code for referral identification
- All referral records must prevent fraud (link parameter modification, self-referral)
- Invitation code mechanism and referral link mechanism should work simultaneously but as different functional paths
- If users click multiple invitation codes, the final referral link used at the time of registration determines the referrer
